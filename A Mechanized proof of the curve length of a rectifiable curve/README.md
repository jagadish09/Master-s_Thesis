# Master's_Thesis:
A mechanized proof of the curve length of a rectifiable curve in ACL2(r).

Files description:

 Master's Thesis: Thesis to prove pi defined in Acl2(r) is equivalent to circumference of the circle over diameter of the circle.

 Thesis_summary: This is summary of my Master's Thesis.
 
 ACL2_Workshop_slides : This is my presentation at ACL2 Workhshop 2017, Austin, TX.
 
 Workspace : Contains Lisp code which shows the proof for length of a continuously differentiable curve and application of the proof                  verifing circumference of the circle with radius r.
